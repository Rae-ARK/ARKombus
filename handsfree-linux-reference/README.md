# HandsFree for Linux

A Bluetooth hands-free utility for Linux — adds hands-free calling to your computer, like a car speakerphone kit.  
Your phone connects via HFP (Hands-Free Profile) and HandsFree handles calls, contacts, and audio routing.

- **Contact sync** — pulls your phone's contact book via PBAP (including profile photos)
- **Contact profiles** — photo, name, full call history, one-click call
- **In-call screen** — shows contact name/photo, live duration timer, volume slider, Mute and End Call buttons
- **Floating call overlay** — always-on-top mini window visible even when the app is minimised; shows avatar, timer, Mute, End Call; flashes red "Call Ended" when the call ends
- **Ringtone** — plays system ringtone on incoming calls; plays ringback tone while waiting for the other person to pick up
- **Call log** — incoming / outgoing / missed calls with contact names, duration, timestamps; right-click to open profile or redial
- **Audio device selection** — choose speaker and microphone directly from the in-call screen

## Supported devices

Any phone that supports **Bluetooth HFP (Hands-Free Profile)** works — that's essentially every smartphone made in the last 15 years. If your phone can connect to a car hands-free kit, it works with HandsFree.

| Platform | Calls | Contact sync |
|---|---|---|
| **iPhone** (iPhone 3G+) | ✅ | ✅ Reliable on all models |
| **Android** (all manufacturers) | ✅ | ⚠️ Requires permission on Android 12+; varies by manufacturer |
| **Older Nokia / feature phones** | ✅ | ❌ No PBAP |
| **Any Bluetooth HFP device** | ✅ | Depends on device |

> **Android note:** Samsung, Pixel, Xiaomi, OnePlus, Sony and all other Android phones work for calls. Contact sync depends on the manufacturer and Android version — you will see a permission prompt on the phone when syncing.

### Host computer requirements

Any Linux computer or laptop with Bluetooth 2.1 or newer. This covers virtually all hardware made after 2008.

| Hardware | Support |
|---|---|
| **Built-in Bluetooth** (laptops, modern desktops) | ✅ Works out of the box |
| **USB Bluetooth dongle** | ✅ Any dongle supported by the Linux kernel |
| **Desktop PC without Bluetooth** | ✅ Add a USB dongle (~€5) |

> **Bluetooth version:** HFP requires Bluetooth 2.1+. For wideband audio (HD voice via mSBC codec) your adapter needs Bluetooth 4.0+. Older adapters fall back to CVSD (narrowband) automatically.

> **Important:** Your computer's Bluetooth adapter must be set to **Hands-Free** role in BlueZ for this app to work. This is what HandsFree registers on startup — do **not** let WirePlumber or PulseAudio claim the HFP role first, or the connection will fail. See the [WirePlumber conflict](#wireplumber-conflict) section below.

## Requirements

### Linux

**Ubuntu / Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install bluez bluez-obexd python3-dbus python3-gi python3-venv python3-full
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Ubuntu 24.04+ / Kubuntu 24.04+:** Python is externally managed — use the install script (`bash scripts/install.sh`) which automatically creates a virtualenv, or run manually:
> ```bash
> python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
> .venv/bin/pip install PyQt6 vobject psutil
> .venv/bin/python3 main.py
> ```

**Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro:**
```bash
sudo pacman -Sy --needed python-dbus python-gobject bluez bluez-obex
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PyQt6` | UI framework |
| `dbus-python` | BlueZ / obexd D-Bus communication |
| `PyGObject` (python3-gi) | GLib main loop integration |
| `vobject` | vCard parsing for PBAP contact sync |
| `psutil` | VoIP process detection |

### Audio

HandsFree uses PipeWire (via `pactl`) for audio routing. PipeWire is the default on Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 34+, and most modern distros.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PavelTarlev1/handsfree-linux.git
cd handsfree-linux
bash scripts/install.sh
python3 main.py
```

The app starts in the system tray. Right-click the headset icon to connect your phone.

**Debug mode** (shows detailed logs):
```bash
python3 main.py --debug
```

---

## Pairing your phone

1. Pair your phone with your computer via system Bluetooth settings (just once).
2. Open HandsFree → right-click tray icon → **Connect**.
3. On Android: accept the contacts permission popup on your phone.  
   On iPhone: go to **Settings → Bluetooth → tap ⓘ next to your computer → enable "Sync Contacts"**.

## WirePlumber conflict

On systems running WirePlumber, it also tries to register the HFP Hands-Free role, causing:

```
org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists
```

Fix: disable WirePlumber's HFP node. See **[docs/wireplumber-setup.md](docs/wireplumber-setup.md)** for step-by-step instructions.
